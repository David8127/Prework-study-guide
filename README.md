# Prework Study Gudie Webpage

## Description

This is a prework study guide that lists the major topics covered in the prework for UCI's coding bootcamp. As a new student in this program, I wanted to create an easily navigable page that showed the main topics covered in the bootcamp. It allows the viewer to easliy see each topic covered and some tips for each one. I learned that setting up an organized study guide is helpful for retaining the information covered about HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript.

You can navigate this study guide to glean each major topic covered in the prework content. The notes help describe each topic (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git) as well as list important commands & common codes that you would encounter in each. Once the URL takes you to the webpage, the DevTools console can be opened to display the running JavaScript.
